Hitbox-Barebone-Bot
===================

This shouldn't be used right out of the box. It's just to show 'how' to connect to web sockets. It's the simplest library I've found that actually works without ripping hair out.

You should at least know some Java to be able to 'manipulate' this to your needs. This isn't a bot, It's just an example of connection.
